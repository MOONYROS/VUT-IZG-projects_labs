# VUT-IZG-projects (2022/2023)

This repository consists of tasks for IZG classes on BUT FIT for the year 2022/2023.
in this repository, there are both:

- exercises/labs
- project

## Exercises/Labs

In `exercises/.`, there are all the finished codes for all the labs but **use them only as an inspiration**.
**Make sure you understand the given task** before you just `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + V` anything from this repository.
You might be tested or examined by the exercise leader, that you understand the code you have written (at least we were).
So please, look at the code **only as the last resort**.
Also, understanding the topic will help you later when writing the exam.

### Note

The whole code is not mine. The labs work in the way that we get a skeleton of a project, that we then have to correctly fill with code (meaning I only wrote certain functions or generally parts of the source file).
Names of true authors of the labs are mentioned in every lab file with name matching `cv[1-5].cpp`. For `cv6.glsl` we were given the task verbally, then wrote the code ourselves.

### Disclaimer

These solutions are only for the year 2022/2023, I do not guarantee, that the assignments won't change and the codes might not work in the future.

## Project

The project (in `project/.`) of this class was aimed on basically programming the graphics card.
To understand how the *OpenGL pipeline* works, what should the optimizations look like, how fast can it be.
Note that this project is **not very well optimized** and can be greatly sped up.
The whole project is written in `C++` and is tested on:

- Windows 11
- MacOS Ventura
- Ubuntu 22.04
